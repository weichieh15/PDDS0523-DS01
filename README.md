The Russo-Ukrainian War, which has been ongoing since February 2014, is a conflict between Russia (with Russian insurgents in Ukraine) and Ukraine. Immediately after the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine, Russia resorted to armed conflict. The political position of Crimea and the Donbas, which are still officially a part of Ukraine according to the international community, was the primary focus of these conflicts. There were maritime accidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions throughout the first eight years of the conflict. Russia's takeover of Crimea was the climax of the intrusions into Ukraine, and it was quickly followed by the start of the conflict in Donbas between rebels supported by Russia and Ukrainian government troops. As Russian forces surrounded Ukrainian territory in 2021, mutual tensions increased throughout the year. After Russia invaded mainland Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the conflict quickly escalated.
